# [[Phone Stone]]

## Description

While holding this magical stone, the user can communicate with other stones of the same set.  The communication may be telepathic, audible, visual, or any combination of the three.  If the stone is used for visual communication, it projects an illusion of the users of the other stones in the set.  The illusion may be no larger than 5 feet on any side.

## History

- A set of phone stones was given to [[000 World Index|the PCs]] by Jonathan Raventhorpe through his intermediary [[Dusseldorf]]
- The description above is an attempt by Cody to put solid rules to the item.  Sam's rules are "just think of them as phone.  You can use them to communicate like phones"
