## Session Summary

 > [!tldr] [[008_20221227]]
 > The [[000 World Index|PCs]] fight off the cultists.  When all are defeated except [[Morena Gloomhawk|Morena]] she reveals that she is a saboteur, only pretending to further the cults goals.  She explains a number of things to the [[000 World Index|PCs]], including that the last time the ritual was attempted it destroyed the planet [[Yazir]], and that the ritual will be attempted tomorrow on [[Nee A'bohr]].  After she gives them coordinates to the ritual site and tells them how to stop it, she leaves and returns to the cult, not wanting to give up her ruse just yet.  As the [[000 World Index|PCs]] race to get to [[Nee A'bohr]] they are stopped by [[Alistair Theodellus I|Alistair Senior]], who is quickly revealed to be possessed by [[Shar]].  [[Shar]] speaks through him to reveal that she is [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]]'s patron, and commands him to leave and go elsewhere to sow chaos.  [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] finds a loophole in the wording of her command, and the [[000 World Index|PCs]] set off for [[Nee A'bohr]].

## Log

- [[Morena Gloomhawk|Morena]] looks and sees [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] and takes only a moment to confusedly speak his name before attacking
- In his mind, [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] hears his mother's voice say, "Make it convincing"
- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] dispatch all the cultists except [[Morena Gloomhawk|Morena]], who stops fighting as soon as there is no one else around.
- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] is filled with questions, and throughout his conversation determines all the following
	- [[Morena Gloomhawk|Morena]] left [[Alistair Theodellus I|Alistair Senior]] 20 years ago
	- During the previous celestial alignment, the ritual was attempted on [[Yazir]]
	- The failed ritual destroyed the planet
	- [[Morena Gloomhawk|Morena]] left to stop the cult to prevent more destruction
		- #ðŸ§µ  [[Yazir]] was destroyed more than 20 years ago, right?
	- [[Tiphollal]] is the current leader of the [[Cult of Khot]]
		- descendent of [[Azeros]], the founder of the cult, who died in the explosion of Cantar
	- the device they have found here is a teleportation gate.  There is system of them linking all the planets which will be in the celestial alignment.
	- This gate links to [[Nee A'bohr]], where the [[Cult of Khot|Cultists of Khot]] plan to perform the ritual
	- The ritual's weak spot is the orb at the center of the ritual.  It is required to channel the energy.
	- It will be under constant guard until the ritual begins.
	- The ritual will begin in 18 hours 17 minutes
- [[Morena Gloomhawk|Morena]] gives the [[000 World Index|PCs]] the coordinates of the ritual site, and wishes [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] blessings of [[Lliira]] (specifically [[Lliira]], not [[Lliira|Gehlira]], the astral elven name for her)
- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] gives [[Morena Gloomhawk|Morena]] a silver coin with three notches cut in the edge.  If they should be separated again he intends to use that coin as a target for the Finding spell.
- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] hurry back to the Theodellus home.  They initially head straight up the secret tunnel towards the church, but upon hearing lots of movement and clinking armor, they continue in the tunnel back to the house.
- Once they've gathered their things, they set toward the [[Diversity]], intending to use the front door of the house
- As they enter the front entryway, they find [[Alistair Theodellus I|Alistair Senior]], with 2 guards blocking their exit.
- [[Alistair Theodellus I|Alistair Senior]] is covered in red and black veins, and when [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] tries to read his thoughts he hears only "YOU ARE MINE", the phrase [[Shar|the Hex]] keeps repeating to him him in his nightmares.  The experience is enough to cause damage
- A conversation follows.  [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] plays it cool but he is deeply shaken by the exchange
- In this conversation,
	- The entity possessing [[Alistair Theodellus I|Alistair's father]] introduces itself as [[Shar]].
	- It also confirms that [[Shar]], [[Shar|The Hex]], and [[Shar|The Black Cloud]] are all the same entity
	- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]]'s paternal great grandfather made a contract with [[Shar]], which also bound his descendants into service
	- [[Shar]] is the source of [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]]'s warlock powers
		- "I gave you that sword"
- [[Shar]] demands a number of things throughout the conversation, at some points holding a knife to [[Alistair Theodellus I|Alistair Senior]]'s throat using his own hand to enforce her will.
- The final demand was worded as such "Leave, never come back, and sow chaos".
- It's implied from earlier in the conversation that they should leave both [[Orphea]] and [[Nee A'bohr]] immediately without disrupting the ritual.
- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] agrees to the letter of her final statement, but notes to himself and the other [[000 World Index|PCs]] that hse did not specify when to leave, or where they should sow chaos.  So while he intends to leave, he plans to sow some chaos on [[Nee A'bohr]] before he does.
