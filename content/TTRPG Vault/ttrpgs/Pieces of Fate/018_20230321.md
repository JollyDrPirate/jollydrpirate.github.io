## Session Summary

 > [!tldr] [[018_20230321]]
 > The [[000 World Index|PCs]] head to the Midtown marketplace to find both [[The Red Masks]]' base of operations, and [[Kiria Evensong|The Juggler]].  The base turns out to be very easy to find, as it is crawling with thugs all wearing red masks.  The compound consists of a 30' stone wall surrounding a dozen or so small buildings, as well as a larger, 3 story stone building at the center.  [[Hex]] investigates but isn't able to find anything immediately useful. <br>
 > There are far to many people in the compound for the [[000 World Index|PCs]] to assault themselves, so they decide to go find the [[Kiria Evensong|The Juggler]] and try to join forces.  As they approacht he [[The Guildhouse]], they are met by a performer and his entourage storming out of the building.  As they enter, they meet [[Kiria Evensong|Moira]], [[Kiria Evensong]]'s assistant.  Eventually [[Kiria Evensong|Moira]] agrees to set up a meeting if the [[000 World Index|PCs]] will fill in the empty spot in her performance schedule for the evening. <br>
 > The [[000 World Index|PCs]] decide on a name for themselves, to be used on the program.  They will be called ==**_[[The Fools Errant]]_**==<br>
 > The [[000 World Index|PCs]] of course agree, and put on a show of [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] singing, [[Grookius Zaius|Grookius]] doing card tricks, and [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] handling visual effects that make the other two's sections worth watching. <br>
 > After the show, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] meet the [[Kiria Evensong|The Juggler]] backstage, and learn that [[Kiria Evensong|Moira]] is in fact the [[Kiria Evensong|The Juggler]].  She agrees to help with their plan of attacking [[The Red Masks]] to draw [[Ozamata]] out of hiding, but before any details can be discussed, a group of [[The Red Masks|Red Masks]] busts through the front door of  [[The Guildhouse]] carrying torches, and their leader says, "Sorry, this place is closed for renovations"

## Chronicle

The [[000 World Index|PCs]] wake in the morning and somewhat miraculously find themselves without hangovers.  Over breakfast, and after a brief conversation with [[Luigi]], they decide that the only useful thing they can do with their day is to head to the Midtown Market and look for [[The Red Masks]]' hideout.<br>
The market is busy.  Full of people moving from shop to shop, buying and selling all manner of goods.  As the [[000 World Index|PCs]] move toward the south side of the market, they prepare for a long day of searching through this crowd for any clue as to the whereabouts of [[The Red Masks]]'s hideout.  However, upon reaching the south edge of the market, they find their search has come to a close almost before it began.<br>
Across the street that acts as the southern border of the market, there stands a large group of people, all wearing red masks.  The masks they wear are made of cloth, laid over the eyes, pulled back above the ears and tied behind the head, with two holes cut out of the front for the eyes.  They also all sport a blue armband, similar to the dock worker the [[000 World Index|PCs]] met when they first arrived.<br>
They are collected outside the gate of some repurposed fortress.  A 30' stone wall surrounds the campus, which is filled with a dozen or so small buildings.  At the center, a larger building stands above the rest, in both demeanor and physical height.  The ground it sits upon is raised above the rest of the compound, as if it needed the help to get it's 3 story roof above those of the single room buildings that surround it.<br>
Taking advantage of the cover the bright morning sun provides, [[Hex]] flies invisibly into the compound for a closer look.  It's clear that the fortifications were abandoned by their previous occupants, perhaps for some time before the [[The Red Masks|Masks]] moved in.  The walls show signs of age and dilapidation.  However, they also show signs of recent repair.  Summed together, the compound is not in a state of ruin, but not quite at full repair either.  It lingers somewhere in the middle, in a state of mild dilapidation. However, while it's walls may not be as strong as they once were physically, they are still quite adept and protecting their secrets.  [[Hex]] is unable to find any information other than what is quickly obvious:  The fortress is far to well guarded for a group of only three to have any success assaulting it.<br>
Their progress stymied in this approach, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] decide to move on to their other lead, securing information and assistance from the [[Kiria Evensong|The Juggler]], [[Kiria Evensong]].  Although they no longer need her help finding the [[The Red Masks|Masks]]' base of operations, they clearly need her help getting in. <br>
[[The Guildhouse]] being a public venue, it is easy enough to find across the marketplace.  As the [[000 World Index|PCs]] approach, they are greeted by more drama than they expected to find, at least before seeing the stage.  A man dressed in extravagant silken, flowing clothes storms out of the front door, waving his arms wildly in anger and shouting a string of curses in some language none of the [[000 World Index|PCs]] understand.  As he tromps away from the building, he passes by a poster bearing his likeness.  "The Great Scarlioni", it reads, "Magician, Daredevil, and Lover", and shows him dramatically casting a spell into the sky, while standing atop a mountain and holding a fainting damsel in his other arm.<br>
He is followed first by two porters, assumedly in his employ, frantically trying to keep up with him while also carrying what appear to be hastily packed trunks containing more of the man's belongings.  Finally, the parade is ended by  a smaller, rounder man dressed plainly but not poorly, carrying a briefcase.  He is speaking in Common as he shouts back toward the building at no one in particular, "Fine!  Good luck finding another act by tonight!"<br>
As unexpectedly as the show began, it is over just as quickly.  This parade of anger and silk passes by the [[000 World Index|PCs]] and into the marketplace before any of them have a chance to truly process what is happening.  However, deciding this hasn't really changed their circumstances at all, they proceed into the [[The Guildhouse]].<br>
Inside they find a well appointed space, open and airy, full of tables and chairs in front of a low, wide stage set at the back of the room.  To the left and right there are raised balconies with more tables set upon them, all with a view of the stage.  Beyond the balconies, through curtained doorways on both sides, private rooms can be found for those more interested in a quite dinner than a show.  As they enter, a familiar face notices them from the balcony, and the street performer who pickpocketed [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] is quick to move out of view. <br>
As they move into the entryway, a meek elven woman wearing large, full circle glasses approaches them, and eventually introduces herself as [[Kiria Evensong|Moira]], the personal assistant to [[Kiria Evensong]].  The meeting gets off to a rought start as [[Kiria Evensong|Moira]] refuses to take them to speak with [[Kiria Evensong]] without first being told the full details of why the [[000 World Index|PCs]] wish to speak with her.  The [[000 World Index|PCs]] however, are hesitant to discuss their plans, or their quest for the [[Pieces of Fate]] with a woman unknown to them in the common room of a group of spies and thieves.  Eventually though, the conversational impasse is breached, in large part by [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]]'s straightforward honesty. <br>
[[Kiria Evensong|Moira]] agrees to set up a meeting with [[Kiria Evensong]], but in exchange she tells the [[000 World Index|PCs]] that they must help her fill the empty slot in her show schedule for the night that Scarlioni has just left open.  After a bit of brainstorming and a practice run or two, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] put together a passable show, involving [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] putting on a vocal performance to call down blessings from some un-specified god, onto [[Grookius Zaius|Grookius]], who uses the blessings to perform fantastic card tricks for the audience.  The vocal performance is augmented by illusory back up singers throughout the room, while [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] uses his experties to create a prop "celestial" to float down from the ceiling and bless [[Grookius Zaius|Grookius]]' cards, as well as providing visual effects to accompany his card tricks. <br>
Before the show, [[Kiria Evensong|Moira]] asks what she should put down for them on the program.  The group decides thew will be called, **_[[The Fools Errant]]_**<br>
Following their performance, [[Kiria Evensong|The Juggler]] herself takes the stage.  Her performance is clearly something practiced and polished, not thrown together in an afternoon.  While the [[000 World Index|PCs]] show was entertaining, [[Kiria Evensong|The Juggler]]'s is masterful. <br>
At the end of the show, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] move to meet [[Kiria Evensong]] backstage.  After approaching and introducing themselves, [[Kiria Evensong|The Juggler]] removes the mask she wore for her performance with a flourish, revealing that [[Kiria Evensong|Moira]] is in fact [[Kiria Evensong|The Juggler]].  The [[000 World Index|PCs]] had already explained to her earlier their plan, to combine forces and assault [[The Red Masks]]' fortress.  The don't need to take the fortress or defeat it's protectors, they only need to draw [[Ozamata]] out from hiding.  Seeing one of his strongest, most visible bases of power will surely enrage him, and he'll use the Red [[Pieces of Fate|Piece of Fate]] to make an example of whoever is moving against him.  Once he arrives, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] will focus on subduing him and taking the stone.  With the stone out of [[Ozamata]]'s grasp, the [[The Jugglers]] can pull back and the status quo between all the gangs of [[The Rock of Bral]] will return to normal. <br>
[[Kiria Evensong]] is on board with the plan, however they don't get a chance to discuss any further before they hear a loud crash from the front door.  Rushing out to the stage to see what's happening, they find a group of a dozen or more [[The Red Masks|Red Masks]] carrying torches and weapons have broken down the door and moved inside.  Their leader looks to the stage and says, "Sorry, this place is closed for renovations"
