> The [[000 World Index|PCs]] travel through wildspace on their way to the nearest planet.  They take turns resting and making repairs, hoping to keep the cost of repairs they hire out as low as possible.  Everyone aboard the ship has strange nightmares while they sleep, each nightmare featuring the destruction of the dreamer's home, and one of the [[Pieces of Fate]].   Once [[Jonathan Raventhorpe|Jonathan]] awakens, he reveals that there is a copy of the map stored on the [[Phone Stone]]s.  He recreates it, and then with the help of BENJI and [[000 World Index|the PCs]], is able to combine that map and BENJI's navigational map to determine they are bound for a planet named [[Illis]].  Once there, they commission repairs for the ship and make their way into town.

## Log

 As the [[000 World Index|PCs]] make their way through wildspace toward the nearest port, they take shifts fixing the ship
- The ship is named [[Diversity]]
- While resting, everyone had nightmares, which included one of the [[Pieces of Fate]]
	- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] dreamed of his home in [[Orphea]], and saw the green [[Pieces of Fate|Piece of Fate]]
		- The dream began in his home as he remembered it as a boy.
		- In the main hall was a golden statue, holding a green stone.
		- He heard his parents fighting, and went to look, arriving just as his father left the room
		- He went into the room to speak to his mother, and give her a hug
		- During the hug she repeatedly said "Never let the world tell you who you are", and held him tighter and tighter
		- When the hug became uncomfortably tight [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] looked up and found it was no longer his mother, but a corpse
		- As he screamed, he found himself in a different place.  He was back in the astral plane, surrounded by the cloud of [[Shar|the Hex]]
		- He heard a voice say something to the effect of "You are mine" to which he replied "I am my own".  After some back and forth, the darkness coalesced into [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]]'s sword, and he saw [[Hex]], his imp familiar fly off
		- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] followed [[Hex]], eventually coming back to his childhood home, but now it was a ruin.
		- The house was destroyed, pieces of it floating nearby where they broke away.
		- The statue in the main hall was blackened, and went to dust at the touch.
		- The green stone in the statue's hand was gone.
		- As [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] investigated the statue once more, it came to life and repeated [[Shar|the Hex]]'s admonition "You are mine!" and grabbed him, just as he woke up
	- [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] dreamed of his home, [[The Rock of Bral]], and saw the red [[Pieces of Fate|Piece of Fate]]
	- [[Grookius Zaius|Grookius]] dreamed of the homeworld of the Hadozee, [[Yazir]], and saw the dark blue [[Pieces of Fate|Piece of Fate]]
- The players were given a puzzle box to do in real life to simulate the complex task of repair a ship they were unfamiliar with.  We did solve it, and were promised a reward of a reduced repair price
- Eventually [[Jonathan Raventhorpe|Jonathan]] woke up, and all the [[000 World Index|PCs]] gathered to discuss their plans.
- [[Jonathan Raventhorpe|Jonathan]] had mad a copy of the map, saving it onto the phone stones
- It took a while, but the [[000 World Index|PCs]] used their knowledge of where the [[Pieces of Fate]] they had dreamed about were, as well as their current location, to cross reference [[Jonathan Raventhorpe|Jonathan]] and [[BENJI]]'s maps, and determine they were headed to [[Illis|Calipso 1L15]], now better known as [[Illis]]
- Upon arrival, they were greeted by a squat man at the dock, repeatedly calling out "What do you want!?!".  Even when answers were given, he repeated the question
- A few moments later another man came running down the dock calling out.
- Turns out the first man was actually a cat named [[Veeter]], who had stolen his owners hat of disguise
- The owner, [[Neerus]] is a Spelljammer repair man
- While negotiating on a price of repairs, Veeter discovered an ancient Bastarian coin on board the ship which [[Neerus]] was interested in.
- [[Neerus]] called in a friend ([[Chumby]]?) to value the coin
- As [[Chumby]] was about to pronounce his evaluation, [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] cast Suggestion on him, suggesting a valuation of 4000 GP
- A little bargaining later, it was agreed that [[Neerus]] would repair and upfit the ship, bringing it up to modern standars and also installing a full battery of weaponry for the price of the Bastarian coin plus 2000 GP
- Repairs are estimated to take 2-3 days
