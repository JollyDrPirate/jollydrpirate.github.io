## Session Summary

 > [!tldr] [[009_20221228]]
 >
> The [[Diversity]] makes its way to [[Nee A'bohr]] without incident.  The coordinates that [[Morena Gloomhawk|Morena]] gave them take them to a large structure, surrounded by an open field in the otherwise forested region of the planet.  A small lake a couple miles away provides them a place to land and disembark.  The [[000 World Index|PCs]] approach the site stealthily from there while BENJI takes the ship back to orbit for safety.  When they arrive at the clearing, [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] sends his homunculus servant to do some reconnaissance.  It relays back to the group information about the structure and the number of [[Cult of Khot|cultists]] there.  Seeing no way to approach without being seen, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] come up with a story to get themselves inside, and approach casually.  The ruse works and they are brought inside where they see a large magical dome being maintained by [[Cult of Khot|cultists]].  At its center there are more cultists, focused on some sort of small creature. The [[000 World Index|PCs]] begin to move around the place as well as their cover will allow and break the 6 teleportation circles around the edge of the structure.  However, when the [[Cult of Khot|cultists]] see them doing this and agree that it's a good idea, they are forced to changed plans.  [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] teleports into the magical dome to grab whatever's at the center.

## Log
- the [[Diversity]] makes it to [[Nee A'bohr]] without incident
- information on [[Nee A'bohr]]
	- located in it's own wildspace
	- no civilized population
	- very green, dense foliage and wildlife.  A wild planet
- There is a large hexagonal structure located at the coordinates [[Morena Gloomhawk|Morena]] gave [[000 World Index|the PCs]].
- The structure is glowing with green magical energy
- the structure sits on a hill, surrounded by an open field for ~450 yards (1350 feet) in all directions
- Surrounding the field is a dense forest
- 2 miles from the structure, [[000 World Index|the PCs]] notice a lake large enough to land in
- BENJI is able to put down there without incident
- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] set a slow pace, walking 20-30 feet off the trail they find in the forest foliage, so as to help avoid detection
- They see no other people on their trek to the structure
- [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] sends his homunculus servant to scout the area as best it can
	- the structure is built of 20' walls, with a flat, open area inside
	- each wall contains an ornate carved archway, allowing movement back and forth from inside and outside the sturcture
	- At the center of the structure is a large arcane circle
	- at least 20 people are within the structure
- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] can see no way to get closer stealthily.  They briefly consider having BENJI pilot the [[Diversity]] into the area to act as either air support or distraction, but he can't operate the ships weaponry on his own.
- Seeing no other option, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] walk up directly to the structure.  When they get fairly close (300 ft), Ducky begins playing his bagpipes, making it exceedingly clear to the [[Cult of Khot|cultists]] that the [[000 World Index|PCs]] are not trying to sneak up on their base.
- When they arrive, they are stopped by the guards, and [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] tells them the following story over the course of the conversation
	- We were part of the group sent to Orphea
	- We were ambushed at the teleportation circle and separated from our leader
	- At some point in the fight, the Hadozee who was part of the ambushing party cast some sort of spell on them.  Seemed like polymorph, but it's lasted to long for that to be it.  It transformed [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] and [[Grookius Zaius|Grookius]] into their current forms, and scrambled [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]]'s brain a bit
	- We couldn't make it back through the circle, so we snuck to the docks and stole a spelljammer
	- We've never piloted a spelljammer, so it was a miracle that we made it here at all, but we did have to crash land in the forest
	- We walked from there, and that's when we lost our robes.  Have you ever tried to go for a hike in a robe?  They snag and catch on everything!
- This story somehow works, and the [[Cult of Khot|cultists]] let the [[000 World Index|PCs]] in.
- Now inside the structure, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] see
	- the center of the area is covered in a dome of magical energy
		- Description
			- dome of energy
			- in it you can see flickering and shifting landscapes
				- Grassy backdrop of Nee A'Bohr
				- large fiery volcano
				- vast ocean
			- all locations happening simultaneously
		- The dome is maintained by 4 [[Cult of Khot|cultists]], with 4 more standing within the circle ready to step in if something happens to them
	- In the center of the dome there are 3 additional [[Cult of Khot|cultists]], focused on some small creature.  The creature is difficult to see through the magic
	- There are runic circles carved into the stone on the floor of each archway.
		- The arch the [[000 World Index|PCs]] pass through is gate 1, and the etchings are blue
		- The passages are numbered clockwise from there
- As the [[000 World Index|PCs]] pass through the archway, [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] uses Mending to "fix" the etched runes on the floor, breaking the circle
- Gate 5 connects to the planet [[Zdzislaw]], which is where the [[000 World Index|PCs]] are told they need to go
- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] causes a distraction so that [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] can break this circle as well
- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] comes up with reasons to go over to circles 4 and 3 and uses mending to stealthy break them as well
- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] continues to arch 2, and uses mending on that circle as well.  The cultist at that gate sees him do this however.
- Surprisingly, the cultists is happy to see him do it, and thinks its a great idea, immediately calling into question the wisdom of the [[000 World Index|PCs]] plan.
	- "That's a great idea!  That way if somebody messes up one of the other rituals they can't get here!"
- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] thought this was the only ritual, and the teleportation circles would be for bringing in further reinforcements, but apparently there are 5 other ritual sites
- As the cultist runs over to tell the others about this great idea, [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] casts Vortex Warp to teleport into the center of the magic circle to steal whatever is at the center, hoping it's the orb that [[Morena Gloomhawk|Morena]] told them about
