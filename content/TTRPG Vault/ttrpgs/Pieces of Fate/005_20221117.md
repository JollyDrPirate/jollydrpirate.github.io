## Log
The [[000 World Index|PCs]] left [[Illis]] and set out toward [[Orphea]]
- On the way
	- While on route, a Damselfly ship flying Guild colors was spotted off the starboard side, approaching the [[Diversity]]
	- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] opted to let it approach
	- Piloting the vessel was a grey bearded Hadozee named [[Captain Kris Kraft]]
	- Over the course of a conversation with him, it became clear that he was scamming other spelljamers into paying fake fines.
	- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] layed it on thick in their conversation to let him know that the [[000 World Index|PCs]] were academy trained and had connections to upper-level administration, so he "let them off with a warning"
	- As he left the [[000 World Index|PCs]] just barely saw the Guild colors be taken down and replaced with some other flag
- the [[000 World Index|PCs]] arrive at [[Orphea]] without any other incidents
- The spelljamming docks and the city are separated by a large wooded green space
- As the [[000 World Index|PCs]] are making their way through en route to [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]]'s family home, they notice an abnormal number of owls, perched and watching them.
- After interacting with one, they decide to keep moving, but notice that they are being followed.
- Keeping ahead of the owls, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] eventually make it into the edge of town, turning back to notice an owl bear watching them from the woods, with some of the owls perched on it.
- The owls all follow the owl bear back into the woods
- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] make their way to the Theodellus home
- Staff at the Theodellus household
	- [[Jarval]] the butler
	- [[Gertrude]] the maid
- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] tries to get in and out of the house quickly, but [[Jarval]] is quick to tell [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]]'s father, [[Alistair Theodellus I|Alistair Senior]], that the [[000 World Index|PCs]]] are there
- The astral elves are currently celebrating a [[Lliira|Gehlira]] related holiday
- [[Alistair Theodellus I|Alistair Senior]] insists that they have a celebratory feast for his son's return
- While freshening up, [[Alistair Theodellus I|Alistair Senior]] tells the [[000 World Index|PCs]] a few things about [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]]'s childhood
	- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]]'s first time riding a horse, his cloak got caught on a thornbush, and tore itself apart on his neck, leaving a bad mark for a week
	- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] had a childhood friend/bully by the name of [[Primaltus]].  He was a boy who lived down the street
- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] goes for a walk about the house, looking for signs that his nightmare about his home may be coming true, but only finds a childhood toy, a pull string gyroscope
- As the [[000 World Index|PCs]] are about to begin feasting they see a group of figures in deep hooded blue robes painting runes on the church of [[Lliira|Gehlira]].
- [[Alistair Theodellus I|Alistair Senior]] seems unbothered and insists that they not worry about it and instead feast
- [[Alistair Theodellus I|Alistair Senior]] also mentions a "slight resurgence" in the [[Cult of Khot]]
- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] and [[Alistair Theodellus I|Alistair Senior]] retire at the end of the feast, each to their own rooms
