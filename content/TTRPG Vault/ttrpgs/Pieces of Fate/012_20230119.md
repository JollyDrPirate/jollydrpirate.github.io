## Session Summary

 > [!tldr] [[012_20230119]]
 > The [[000 World Index|PCs]] leave [[Nee A'bohr]] and head for [[The Rock of Bral]].  Immediately upon landing, they are scammed to pay a docking fee.  [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] was prepared for this, as he grew up here, but the rest of the group were not.  The [[000 World Index|PCs]] make their way to [[The Happy Beholder]], where they meet [[Luigi]], a sort of father figure from [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]]'s childhood.  Then they go to [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]]'s childhood home and meet his mother.  While in his childhood home, an old acquaintance stops by, [[Ozamata]]. He is the leader of a powerful gang on [[The Rock of Bral]].  He takes no time to remind [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] how much he enjoys being cruel and using his power by indicating he killed the man who charged [[000 World Index|the PCs]] a docking fee, even though that man was his employee.  The [[000 World Index|PCs]] return to [[The Happy Beholder]] to get more information from [[Luigi]], and come up with a plan to infiltrate [[Ozamata]]'s warehouses and see if he has the red [[Pieces of Fate|Piece of Fate]].
