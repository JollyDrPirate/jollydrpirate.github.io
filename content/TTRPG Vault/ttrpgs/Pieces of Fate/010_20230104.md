## Session Summary

 > [!tldr] [[010_20230104]]
 > A fight breaks out between the cultists and the [[PCs]]. Heavily outnumbered, all the [[PCs]] quickly cast some form of protective magic to keep them safe throughout this fight.  Slowly but surely, they are able to whittle down the cultists and even the odds.  As the tide turns, and the cultists powering the ritual begin to fall, their remaining comrades begin to sacrifice themselves to keep the ritual going.

## Log

- In the magical dome
	- impish devil creature at the center
	- chest cavity has been flayed open
	- surging green light emanating from the open cavity
- #ðŸ§µ Jonathan's spirit guardians take the form of "writhing tentacles, but the good kind" - Sam Johnson, Dungeon Master
- Once the tides start to turn, cultists start sacrificing themselves on the spots where they previously stood to maintain the ritual.  This seems to power the ritual as well, maintaining the dome
