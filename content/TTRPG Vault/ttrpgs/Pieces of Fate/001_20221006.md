## Log

- [[Grookius Zaius]], [[Jameson Ducky Antidid]], and [[Alistair Theodellus II]] all disembark from their individual transports at the [[Port Royal]] docks
- They meet each other en route to the [[Rusty Nail|Rusty Nail Tavern]], their old hangout spot from when they were in [[Spelljammer Academy]]
- Once there, they find a table and are served by a gruff but friendly waitress named [[Eloise]]
- As [[000 World Index|the PCs]] begin to share stories of what they have been up to in the 5 years since graduation, they are interupted by an old classmate, [[Dusseldorf]]
- [[Dusseldorf]] gives each of the [[000 World Index|PCs]] a [[Phone Stone]], saying that they were given to him to pass on to the group from [[Jonathan Raventhorpe]]
- Shortly after, the bar is set upon by a large group of pirate bandits
- The [[000 World Index|the PCs]] manage to escape the bar and save [[Dusseldorf]] using a stet of tunnels that lead out of the bar
- They had used the tunnels while in the Acedemy to escape after [[Alistair Theodellus II]] broke up with his girlfriend [[Shantana]]
- They used the tunnels to reach the other side of town, where [[Dusseldorf]] had informed them [[Jonathan Raventhorpe|Jonathan]] was waiting for them
- After reachign [[Jonathan Raventhorpe]]'s ship, they met [[Jonathan Raventhorpe|Jonathan]] and Captain [[George North]]
- The two explained to the [[000 World Index|PCs]] background information on the [[Pieces of Fate]] and that [[Jonathan Raventhorpe|Jonathan]] has a map showing thier locations
- It is also revealed that [[Jonathan Raventhorpe|Jonathan]] already possesses one of the [[Pieces of Fate]]
- It is a blue stone left to him from his mother, which seems to allow him to teleport, but at some sort of physical cost to him
	- #ðŸ§µ What is the cost of using the stone?
- #ðŸ§µ It is implied that [[Jonathan Raventhorpe|Jonathan]] stole the map from some previous employer of his
- The crew moves to the main deck and is served drinks by [[Short JIm]]
- [[Alistair Theodellus II]] likes [[Short JIm]] and in an attempt to get to know him better and learn if he would like to be friends [[Alistair Theodellus II]] uses his Helm of Telepathy to cast detect thoughts on him, finding his mind to be completely devoid of thought
	- Cody took this to mean that Sam was running out of patience for his hijinks and didn't want to continue coming up with details for a throwaway NPC
- The captain soon requested the map from [[Jonathan Raventhorpe|Jonathan]] so he can begin navigating the ship on the proper course
- [[Alistair Theodellus II]] was immediately suspicious of this, as the ship was already travelling at Spelljamming speed, so a course would already be set
- [[Alistair Theodellus II]] cast Detect Thoughts on the captain and finds his mind is also blank.  When engaged in conversation while under the spell effect, the thoughts he spoke out lout would appear a moment before he said them, but no other thoughts were there
- Before [[Alistair Theodellus II]] could act on this information, and as soon as the map was in the captain's possession, the crew ambushed the [[000 World Index|PCs]] and threw them overboard
- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] and [[Jonathan Raventhorpe|Jonathan]] manage to stick together as they fell, in part due to [[Jameson Ducky Antidid]]'s quick thinking using his Immovable Rod and [[Alistair Theodellus II]] using mage hand and a rope
	- How will the Immovable Rod work on Spelljammers from now on?  Immovable relative to the ship or to the universe?
		- Immovable Rod will be immovable relative to the source of gravity the rod is currently being subjected to
- There is limited time before they will run out of air, so they all grab onto [[Jonathan Raventhorpe|Jonathan]], who uses his Piece of Fate to teleport them
- As he uses the Piece, it shatters and explodes
- Immediately after, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] all fall to the ground, in some unknown location
