## Session Summary

 > [!tldr] [[006_20221207]]
 > Following the welcome feast, [[000 World Index|the PCs]] sneak into the night to investigate the church, where they saw it being graffitied during the day.  They find the front of the house heavily guarded for reasons unknown, so they decide to slip out through the garden, only to find it infested with mimics.  After a quick fight to dispatch them, they eventually make it to the church but find few clues outside, the graffiti having already been cleaned.  However, they do see lights on within the church, and hear the organ being played.  The melody floating on the air sounds familiar, almost like a childhood lullaby.  Moving inside to investigate, they find a blue robed figure on the organ balcony.  Stealth fails the [[000 World Index|PCs]] as they approach and the figure turns and jumps off the balcony onto the main floor, before running to one of the altars and disappearing after casting Plane Shift.  Alistair just caught a glimpse of the figure's face however, and is nearly certain that it was his long lost mother, [[Morena Gloomhawk]].  With nothing left to investigate within the church, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] begin to head back to the house only to find another group of [[Cult of Khot|Cultists of Khot]] in the church courtyard.  [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]]'s Helm of Telepathy reveals that they are practicing the ritual they plan to perform to bring [[Shar|Khot]] back to this plane.

## Log
The [[000 World Index|PCs]] end the feast and return to their rooms
- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] sneaks to the room the others are sharing and proposes they all go investigate the church they saw being graffitied earlier
- To avoid waking and involving [[Alistair Theodellus I|Alistair Senior]], they decide to sneak out the window
- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] rolls a 1 on his stealth check, and [[Jarval]] notices him leaving, but doesn't do much about it
- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] head for the front of the house, intending to exit through the main gate, but find that the front yard is covered in temple guards.
- The house was not guarded during [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]]'s youth, so he doesn't know why the guards are here or how they will react to the [[000 World Index|PCs]]
- All this uncertainty leads the [[000 World Index|PCs]] to decide to exit through the gardens
- The garden is walled in by hedges, but the greenhouse has a door to the street outside.
- As the [[000 World Index|PCs]] approach the greenhouse, [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] hears a skittering sound coming from within, but no one can see anything alive or moving inside
- Rather than deal with whatever is within the greenhouse, they decide to scale the hedge
- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]], using his climbing gear, summits the hedge
- As he tries to help the others up, he once again hears the skittering noise, and looking up sees statues from the house moving across the lawn toward them.
- [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] responds to [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]]'s warning by spinning around and shooting immediately
- Once combat breaks out, the statues reveal themselves to be mimics
- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] quickly realizes that the hedge is also infested with juvenile mimics
- The group dispatches the whole group of mimics without too much fuss, and hurries away from the grounds before the guards come to see what's happening
- At the church, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] don't find anything of note with their investigation
- The vandalism has already been dealt with
- However, there are lights on within the church, and someone is playing a song which [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] finds familiar
- Upon entering the church and climbing to the organ balcony, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] find a blue cloaked figure playing the organ
- Although the [[000 World Index|PCs]] try to approach quietly, the figure notices their presence and darts away, making it downstairs and away from the[[000 World Index|PCs]] before they have much time to react
- The cloaked figure climbs into a fountain on one end of the church and cast a spell that the group recognizes as Plane Shift
- However, before casting the spell the figure turns to face the [[000 World Index|PCs]], revealing that they are a dark elven woman
- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] is nearly certain, based on what he saw and by looking at [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]]'s memory as well, that the figure is in fact his mother, [[Morena Gloomhawk|Morena]]
- After processing that for a moment, speaking amongst themselves, and looking around a bit, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] decide to return to the Theodellus manor
- Upon exiting the church, they find a circle of [[Cult of Khot|Cultists of Khot]] around a blue fire outside.
- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] are able to sneak close enough for [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] to read the thoughts of the leader
	- They are preparing a ritual
	- Will be performed at the end of the Festival of Gelira
	- A celestial alignment will occur at that time
	- They believe performing the ritual then will allow them to bring [[Shar|Khot]] back to this plane
- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] steps out of the shadows and casts suggestion on the cult leader "Hello, the 4 of us are very interested in joining the cult and seeing the return of [[Shar|Khot]].  I suggest you tell us everything we need to know about the ritual, especially how it could be stopped, so we can defend it properly"
