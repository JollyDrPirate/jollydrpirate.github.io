## Session Summary

 > [!tldr] [[007_20221216]]
 > Under the effect of [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]]'s Suggestion spell, the leader of the small group of [[Cult of Khot|Cultists of Khot]] reveals a wealth of information about the ritual they plan to perform to bring [[Shar|Khot]] to this plane.  The [[000 World Index|PCs]] take all this in stride and watch as the cultists begin their practice ritual.  However, when the ritual begins to appear dangerous, they have no choice but to attack to stop the spell.  [[Grookius Zaius|Grookius]] wins the group a decisive victory with a strategic casting of Tidal Wave, allowing the [[000 World Index|PCs]] to call the guard and arrest the unconscious cultists.  Returning home, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] find an unhappy [[Alistair Theodellus I|Alistair Senior]].  He does not approve of their methods but eventually decides to let it be and gives [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] a key to [[Morena Gloomhawk|Morena]]'s old study.  The [[000 World Index|PCs]] immediately move there to investigate, and find a secret tunnel hidden under the desk.  Following the tunnel they move steadily downward until they find themselves on the bottom of [[Orphea]], with an open view down into the Astral Sea.  It is here that they find an ancient platform, orbited by stone rings carved with arcane runes, emitting a similar power to what they saw in the practice ritual. As they investigate, a group of cultists appears via teleportation on the center of the platform.  Standing in their center, issuing orders, is [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]]'s mother, [[Morena Gloomhawk]].  As [[Grookius Zaius|Grookius]] and [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] quickly hide, [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] simply stands in the path and says, "Hi Mom".

## Log

- The leader of this band of [[Cult of Khot|Cultists of Khot]] falls under the effects of [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]]'s suggestion spell, and gives away plenty of information
	- Says they love Gelira, but also [[Shar|Khot]].
	- Gelira can't exist without [[Shar|Khot]].  Ying/Yang
	- The Ritual
		- 5 people needed
		- Many around and waiting to step in
		- Must get in touch with the darkness of the world, and bring it forward
		- 1 ritual site
		- The whole thing will only last 1-2 minutes
		- Will take place "in the church" in an underground area far beneath the public space
- Eventually the [[Cult of Khot|Cultists of Khot]] begin a practice ritual
- They chant in a language that seems to be the vocalized version of the same language as all the runes the [[000 World Index|PCs]] have been running into
- A blue ball of fire forms in the center of their circle.  It begins to float, spin, and expand
- The ritual seems to have some sort of effect on [[Grookius Zaius|Grookius]], specifically his wild magic
- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] attack to end the ritual when the fireball reaches 25' in diameter
- [[Grookius Zaius|Grookius]] creates a tidal wave that knocks out all the [[Cult of Khot]] in a single blow
- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] stabilize the cultists and turn them over to the guard
- When the [[000 World Index|PCs]] return to the house, they are greeted first by [[Jarval]] and then by [[Alistair Theodellus I|Alistair Senior]]
- [[Alistair Theodellus I|Alistair Senior]] is not happy with the events of the night and shows some of his true colors to the [[000 World Index|PCs]], who (other than [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]]) liked him fairly well when they first met
- Eventually though [[Alistair Theodellus I|Alistair Senior]] gives [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] a key to [[Morena Gloomhawk|Morena]]'s old study
- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] investigate thoroughly, and eventually find that the chair at [[Morena Gloomhawk|Morena]]'s desk is part of a mechanism that opens a secret tunnel.
- The tunnel leads first under the church, then much farther down to the bottom edge of [[Orphea]], such that the PCs can see down into the Astral Sea
- Along the way, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] pass through a number of abandoned rooms, and find more information
	- A letter describing the previous celestial alignment
	- Another letter describing the ritual
		- There are multiple copies of this one - [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] takes one copy and [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] takes another
- Eventually the [[000 World Index|PCs]] find their way to a large arcane structure, consiting of a central, circular platform surrounded by rings which orbit it
- The rings are engraved with huge runes, matching those that were in the red book and on the side of the church
- As the [[000 World Index|PCs]] examine the structure, it lights up with a blue flame similar to the practice ritual, and a group of 7 people suddenly appear on the platform. 
	- 4 cultits
	- 2 cultis in heavy armor
	- [[Morena Gloomhawk]]
- [[Grookius Zaius|Grookius]] runs back a short way and hides behind a pillar 
- [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] jumps off the platform and uses his immovable rod to hang, suspended just below the edge, out of sight.
- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] stands in the center of the path and calls out "Hi Mom"
