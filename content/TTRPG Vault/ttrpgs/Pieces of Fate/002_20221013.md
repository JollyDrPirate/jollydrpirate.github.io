## Log

The [[000 World Index|PCs]] find themselves on solid ground, in an unknown location
- It is a small, circular, domed space
- the floor has a large red arcane symbol drawn on it, softly glowing red
- The walls and ceiling are some sort of opaque blast mist
- Jonathan has been knocked into a deep sleep by the stesses of using the [[Pieces of Fate |Piece of Fate]]
- Alistair casts Dancing Lights and uses the orbs of light to test the darkeness.
- Eventually the group determines that the mist can be dispelled with a combination of light and life, so they begin down the dark path
- They soon encounter a crystal, which begins to glow with white light as they approach
- The light quickly turnes red, and then explodes.  Luckily the [[000 World Index|PCs]] move far enough away to be unaffected
- The PCs encounter another crystal, as well as a group of skittering enemies that form from the darkness.  One charges the party and explodes, similarly to the crystals.  The others claw at the [[000 World Index|PCs]], but all are dispatched quickly.
- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] continue down the path, turning left at any branch.  There are mores crystals and more skittering and exploding enemies, but all are handled similarly to the first
- Eventually the group finds a secret door, which leads to a small alcove with a treasure chest in it
- The treasure chest contains a cannon.  It's Ghallarhorn.
- #‚ùì The chest also contains a bag of gold. "It's too much to count quickly"
- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] continue, finding a second secret door.  This one leads to another alcove with an altar on it. On the altar is a key, which looks like it would have opened the chest they already looted
- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] soon find themselves on another floor sigil, this one green.
- When they step on it it lights up, and starts to dispell the darkness.
- Alistair notices that casting spells while on the sigil seems to speed up the darkness clearing effect.
- Noticing this, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] cast spells quickly to supercharge the effect, and the darkness is dispelled, and the remaining skittering creatures are killed.
- The PCs can now see that they are in an enormous cave
- A bridge is also formed, showing the path forward
- The bridge leads across a chasm to a second cave.
- This one has a large opening in the roof, providing a clear view of Wildspace
- There is also a derelect spelljammer, resting on the surface of the water filing the cave.
- #üßµ  What is the name of the ship?
- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] explore the ship, and find an autognome rusted into place on the spelljamming helm
- [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]]and [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] cast mending on the autognome, and it wakes up
- The autognome's name is [[BENJI]]
- Through conversation with [[BENJI]], the [[000 World Index|PCs]] determine that he and the ship have been maroonded here for ~1000 years
- [[BENJI]] is connected directly to the ships navigation systems.  He is integrated with the ship
- [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] says the ship needs power to travel, which can be provided by spending spell slots into the power source
- As the group is about to get under way, a large knight-like creature breaks through the deck grating, attacking the [[000 World Index|PCs]]
- It's not a pushover, but the [[000 World Index|PCs]] put him down
- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] lands the final blow.
	- He cast Bless and used Hexblade's curse on round 1
	- On round two he cast Eldritch blast and crit on a 19 twice
	- He used Quicken spell to cast eldritch blast again, hitting one more time
- With the enemy defeated, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] and [[BENJI]] set off, headed for the nearest system, hoping that its full of friendly people and that there is a spelljammer mechanics shop there to fix up the ship
