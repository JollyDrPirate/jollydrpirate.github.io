## Session Summary

 > [!tldr] [[015_20230223]]
 > The [[000 World Index|PCs]] immediately jump into action against the fungus-covered-zombie-troll-looking-thing.  The encounter gets off to a rough start, but the tide quickly turns when the [[000 World Index|PCs]] begin to use the terrain more to their advantage.  Once the troll has been dispatched, and the [[000 World Index|PCs]] take a moment to catch their breath, they begin to examine their surroundings more closely, looking for the best way forward.  A closer examination of the large hole at the center of the room from which the troll emerged reveals that there is a tunnel cut into the side of the shaft.  The [[000 World Index|PCs]] spent a fair amount of time deciding what the safest way to get down to that tunnel would be, eventually deciding to tie ropes to [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]]'s immovable rod and just climb down on those.  <br>
 > This turned out to be a bad plan, as both [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] and [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] could not hold the rope and would have grievously injured themselves if not for [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]]'s Featherfall spell.  Proceeding down the tunnel they soon found a portal made of bright blue light.  [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] was quick to press through, while [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] and [[Grookius Zaius|Grookius]] hesitated, but they soon followed in his path and they all found themselves in a large open chamber.<br>
 > A pool of water filled the room opposite them, and large tentacles spouted out of it resting against the walls.  As they approached and made themselves known, the tentacles receded and a gargantuan, nebulous, black figure rose from the waters.  It's eyes glowed red, leaving traces of light as it moved.  It spoke to them in a deep rumbling voice, identifying itself as [[The Unknowable One]].  As the conversation with it proceeded, information was not flowing smoothly.<br>
 > Soon [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] noticed something was off, and sent [[Hex]] to investigate.  [[Hex]] soon found a hidden side room, with a hooded figure standing at a control panel, clearly operating the illusion of [[The Unknowable One]].  In a tense moment, the figure used the rooms defenses to shock [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] for what it deemed a lack of respect.  In response, [[Hex]] placed his invisible stinger on the figure's throat, as [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] issued a threat.<br>
 > The tension quickly dissipated as the group decided to all start over, and the hooded figure introduced himself as [[The Unknowable One|Leonard Berenstein]], an Illithid who had been cast out of his society for his physical deformities, and had set himself up as the spymaster of [[The Rock of Bral]].  However, he went on to explain tat his spy operations had been severely disruped by [[Ozamata]]'s gang, so he could only say that he knew [[Ozamata]]'s base of operations was somewhere in Midtown.  He advised the [[000 World Index|PCs]] to find and work with [[Meredin Sandyfoot]] and [[Kiria Evensong|The Juggler]], to see if they knew any more and could help pinpoint [[Ozamata]].  As their conversation drew to a close, [[The Unknowable One|Leonard]] gave [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] a sending stone to communicate with, and teleported them back to the top surface of the lake.
