## Session Summary

 > [!tldr] [[016_20230301]]
 > As the PCs reappear on the beach, [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] immediately launches back into his sales pitch, and quickly catches the attention of a trio of richy rich beach goers.  After a brief discussion they tip the group for the information and indicate they will be sending their servants over to [[Khoursorli Blessedbane's Toys, Trinkets, and Games|KB Games]] to buy their own fishsuits.  Seeing no other easy sales, the PCs leave to report back to [[Khousorli Blessedbane|Khousorli]]<br>
 > Along the way they cross paths with with a small group of [[The Jugglers]] doing a street performance to advertise the evening show at [[The Guildhouse]].  [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] and [[Hex]] are immediately on the lookout for an alterior motive for the street show, but don't see anything suspicious.  [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] takes a flyer from on of [[The Jugglers]] so the [[000 World Index|PCs]] can attend the show later that night, and hopefully make contact with [[Kiria Evensong]], [[Kiria Evensong|The Juggler]]'s leader.  However, things turn sour when [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] goes to tip the group and realizes that he has been pickpocketed.  Quickly clocking that it must have been the person handing out flyer, [[Alistair]]  tracks him down and threatens to kill him if his money isn't returned.  Eventually, after a show of magic and force, [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] gets his money back. <br>
 > With no further incidents, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] make it back to [[Khoursorli Blessedbane's Toys, Trinkets, and Games|KB Games]]. [[Khousorli Blessedbane|Khousorli]] takes back his fishsuits, returns the [[000 World Index|PCs]] collateral, and gives the group some information on how to find [[Meredin Sandyfoot]].  As the [[000 World Index|PCs]] head out, they promise to come back and discuss the future of their business dealings with [[Khousorli Blessedbane|Khousorli]]. <br>
 > Acting on [[Khousorli Blessedbane|Khousorli]]'s advise, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] head to the marketplace in [[The Burroughs]].  Just outside the marketplace, they come across a farmer with an overturned cart, who is in need of help finding his chickens.  He tells the [[000 World Index|PCs]] that he has 6 chickens, all lost somewhere within the market.  The [[000 World Index|PCs]] agree to look for the chickens while they're in the market.  As they explore the various shops, including a painting sales booth, a ceramics store, a clothing boutique, a beer tent, and ameat salesman, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] slowly regather the chickens.  When they return the last chicken, the farmer introduces himself as [[Mark Sandyfoot]], and invites them all to join him and his brother [[Meredin Sandyfoot]] for dinner that evening.
