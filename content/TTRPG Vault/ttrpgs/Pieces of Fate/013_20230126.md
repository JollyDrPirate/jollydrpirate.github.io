## Session Summary

 > [!tldr] [[013_20230126]]
 > The [[000 World Index|PCs]] go travel out into wildspace to meet [[Martell]], the agent of [[The Unknowable One]].  The meeting coordinates take them to a wrecked nautilus ship.  It shows no signs of life.  There are holes ripped through the hull all throughout the ship, and the weapons have all been salvaged.  They do however see a humanoid figure standing on the deck, wearing ragged street clothes.  The [[000 World Index|PCs]] move to the derelict ship and meet with [[Martell]], who turns out to not really know much.  After a someone tense conversation wherein the only thing [[Martell]] tells them is that [[The Unknowable One]] is in the caves beneath [[The Rock of Bral]], (which they already knew), the [[000 World Index|PCs]] depart and make plans to get to the bottom of the lake to enter the caves.
 > Back at the Rock, they move to the dwarven district to find some means of diving to the bottom of the lake.  They soon find [[Khoursorli Blessedbane's Toys, Trinkets, and Games]], and its proprietor [[Khousorli Blessedbane]].  After a bit of negotiation, the [[000 World Index|PCs]] and [[Khousorli Blessedbane|Khousorli]] come to a business agreement:  The [[000 World Index|PCs]] will work to drum up business for his fishsuits, if he will loan them 3 for an initial demonstration.  The [[000 World Index|PCs]] will take a small cut of this first sale, and then negotiate their cut on future sales after they've proven their worth.
 > The [[000 World Index|PCs]] head to the lake where they put on a show for the local beachgoers, promising to return in less than 3 days due to the extreme protection afforded them by the fishsuits.  With their marketing campaign concluded, they dive to the other surface of the lake.  When they arrive, they find 3 tunnels, and send [[Hex]] to scout ahead.  Down one tunnel he finds a cloud of fungal spores, and when he begins to cough on the bad air, a clicking monster runs down the dark tunnel toward them.
