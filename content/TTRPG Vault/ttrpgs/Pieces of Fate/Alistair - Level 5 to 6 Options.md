# [[Alistair - Level 5 to 6 Options]]

As [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] levels up from 5 to 6, there is a compelling argument for taking a level in either Sorcerer or Warlock

**Final Decision**  - Warlock.  The extra versatility provided by the Imp familiar, and upgrading Pact slots to 2nd level are more widely useful upgrades than bumping CHA and getting elven accuracy.  It also helps to know that D4 went this route as well, so I'm probably moving in the right direction.

## Sorcerer

### Benefits
- Raise Charisma
	- modifier goes to +4
	- spell attack to +7
	- spell save to 15
- Gain a cantrip
- Gain a spell - hold person or misty step
- Gain a 2nd level slot
- Gain 1 sorcery point
- Elven Accuracy

### Thoughts
This is the mathematically better option.  [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] is already behind the curve on character optimization, as the math going into moster design is expecting a +4 in the primary stat already.  I think this is the option I'm more excited for as well. That first time that Darkness, Devil Sight, Hexblade's Curse, and Elven Accuracy all come together is going to be super exciting.

All that said, everyone in the party is behind the expected math - everyone has a +3 primary stat right now.  Knowing that, I think the risks of putting off this bump are pretty low.  [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] has been performing well in combat already.  I think the larger concern is probably sustainability at this point, and Sorcerer is the weaker option for improving that.

## Warlock

### Benefits
- Pact slots upgrade to 2nd level
- Gain a spell - shield
- replace a spell - hellish rebuke for charm person
- Pact of the Chain
	- Find Familiar

### Thoughts

This option is harder to quantify, because it's not changing any of [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]]'s numerical values.   However, there is huge value in getting his Pact slots up to 2nd level.  It allows for more castings of  Darkness and/or Spiritual Weapon, especially remembering that those slots return on a short rest.  Also, being able to burn them to replenish sorcery points would be very nice.

Potentially even more beneficial though, is access to an Imp familiar.  This would practically be an additional member of the party (outside of combat).  It's proficiency with Stealth, and invisibility ability would fill in a hole in the party's capabilities that really hindered us in the last adventure.
