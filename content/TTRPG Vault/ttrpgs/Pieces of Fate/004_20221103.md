## Session Summary

 > [!tldr] [[004_20221103]]
 > The [[000 World Index|PCs]] make their way into town in search of work while they wait for [[Diversity]] to be repaired.  Once there, they find the town full of odd people who live with strange customs.  While searching the local book store, [[Rochforth Oddities & Occult Tomes]], they come across a strange tome filled with runes.  Before they understand what's happening a death curse starts spreading from the tome, creating red and black veins on the arms and faces of it's victims before killing them seconds later.  The [[000 World Index|PCs]] are able to break the curse, but not until after it kills a number of townsfolk.

## Log

the [[000 World Index|PCs]] make their way into [[Illis]] to find a way to spend their downtime
- In town they find a number of shops to explore
	- tavern
	- a bookstore, [[Rochforth Oddities & Occult Tomes]]
		- owner: [[Marmaduke]]
		- small child out front doing advertising, [[Allen Lee Pitterpatter]]
	- blacksmith
	- #🧵  Ship Jousting location
- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] go to the tavern for a drink and to get advice from the tavernkeeper
- Tavern is owned and operated by a man named [[Godsgift]]
	- #❓  what was Godsgift's last name?
- [[Godsgift]] is generally unhelpful with pointing the [[000 World Index|PCs]] in any sort of direction
- PCs go to the bookstore to look for information on the [[Pieces of Fate]] and illithid
- [[Marmaduke]] goes into the back to look for books on those subjects
- While waiting the [[000 World Index|PCs]] look around and find
	- a book of Illustrations (found by [[Grookius Zaius|Grookius]])
	- Found by [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]]
		- History of the Church of the Goddess of Joy
			- LLiira
			- Cult of Shar
				- Opposite of Llira
		- Monster Manual
			- entry on Illithid - deeply magical, magic is less effective
	- Red Book found by [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]].  It has 3 lines of text in an unknown language.
		- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] doesn't read it, but it looks familiar
- [[Marmaduke]] was taking a while, so the [[000 World Index|PCs]] go to look and find him sprawled on the ground
- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] turned him over and saw that he had black and red patterns on his hands and face, and he attacked
- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] accidentally killed him in self defense
- In the red book [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] found, the first line becomes crossed out, as more lines start to fill in
- [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] finds a riddle next to a puzzle tube, solving it unlocks a cypher for the red book
>[!note]
>>the ruler gone
>>the language dead
>>the secret to the Book of Red
- The lines in the book are names.  When the line is crossed out, the person dies
- Decrypting the line in the book before it is crossed out saves the life of the person
- The [[000 World Index|PCs]] are listed, but save themselves
- Lastly, the players (Cody, Aaron, and Drew) are listed in the book
- Identify confirms that the saved NPCs were under the affect of a killing curse
- The Red Book is from [[Orphea]]
