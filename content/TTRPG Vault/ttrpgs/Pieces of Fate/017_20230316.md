## Session Summary

 > [!tldr] [[017_20230316]]
 > The [[000 World Index|PCs]] don't want to show up empty handed to the dinner party, so after a bit of discussion they decide to buy a barrel of ale to give to the hosts.  With that done, they set off for the Sandyfoot home <br>
 > When they arrive, [[Mark Sandyfoot|Mark]] greets them at the door, as well as one of the house servants, [[James]]. Somewhat surprisingly, [[James]] easily takes the barrel of ale which [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] had been carrying, and walks it into the kitchen, while [[Mark Sandyfoot|Mark]] leads the [[000 World Index|PCs]] into the parlor to meet the other guests. <br>
 > The parlor is a cozy room with lots of seating, a warm fire burning in the fireplace, and candles throughout the room lending the space a warm, inviting glow.  Off to one side a table of hors d'oeuvres and an open punch bowl.  Between information from Mark, and overheard conversations as the group moves toward the table, they learn more about the other guests. <br>
 > [[Meredin Sandyfoot]], the current Sandyfoot patriarch, is in attendance.  His sister [[Mildred Sandyfoot]] is sitting nearby conversing with him.  Meredin is flanked by two tall human men, [[James]] and another very similar looking man, [[Jonathan]]. <br>
 > [[Professor Geronimo Heinz]] is an academic looking half orc man, wearing a tweed jacket with elbow patches and large glasses.  He stands conversing with [[Madame Latrocia Mactis Thorn]], who seems entirely disinterested in the topic, but the Professor is entirely unaware that his audience is not listening.<br>
 > The [[000 World Index|PCs]] move to get drinks, and then to join the conversation with [[Professor Geronimo Heinz|Professor Heinz]] and [[Madame Latrocia Mactis Thorn|Madame Thorn]].  [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] maneuvers the conversation such that the professor and [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] move to their own separate conversation, allowing him to speak on his own with [[Madame Latrocia Mactis Thorn|Madame Thorn]].  Thankful for being freed from the professor, she happily engages in the conversation and eventually agrees to introduce [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] to [[Meredin Sandyfoot]]. <br>
 > While he is conversing, [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] is not drinking, but the other two are.  As they begin to drink, they begin to act strangely.  At one point [[Grookius Zaius|Grookius]] blurts out that he killed his entire family, and without any preamble and harely any prompting [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] professes that they are all questing to find the [[000 World Index|The World of the Pieces of Fate]].  [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] eventually sips his drink while conversing with [[Meredin Sandyfoot]], and realizes that the punch is magically spiked.  It seems to be affecting him differently than the others though - while they seem to be compelled to blurt out their thoughts, [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] is still in control of when he speaks, but may not speak anything but the truth. <br>
 > Moving to dinner, [[Alistair]] has gone quiet in order to not blurt out more secrets, while [[Ducky]] and [[Grookius]] try and control their unruly minds.  Somehow, they are able to make it through dinner (a frankly somewhat dry roasted chicken breast) without any major incidents.  As the other guests move back to the parlor to continue the evening, [[Meredin Sandyfoot]] holds them back to discuss business. <br>
 > With all of them, including Meredin, affected by the truth serum in some way, the conversation moves quickly.  The [[000 World Index|PCs]] learn that [[Ozamata]] has taken control of a gang known as [[The Red Masks]], who previously operated separately from his gang, and often fought with [[The Jugglers]].  Now, they still fight with [[The Jugglers]], but as pawns in [[Ozamata]]'s schemes.  [[The Red Masks]]'s base of operations is south of the market in midtown. [[Meredin Sandyfoot|Meredin]] advises that [[Ozamata]] would stop at that location fairly often, as well as the docks.  Finally, [[Meredin Sandyfoot|Meredin]] offers the help of his bodyguards, [[James]] and [[Jonathan]], who are in fact not human but centaur twins who only inherited the human halfs of each of their parents.  [[Meredin Sandyfoot|Meredin]] gives [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] a one time use sending stone, which will call those two to it if it is smashed.  [[Meredin Sandyfoot|Meredin]] also gives each of them a golden ticket to the show at [[The Guildhouse]] tomorrow evening, which will mark them as under his protection to all members of [[The Jugglers]].  <br>
 > With their business concluded, they all return to the party.  With the ale flowing, each of the [[pcs]] takes a chance to show off their skills - [[Alistair Theodellus II|Alistair]] puts on a masterful vocal performance with the help of an illusory back up choir, [[Jameson Ducky Antidid|Ducky]] shows off his athletic prowess by outracing the two centaurs, and [[Grookius Zaius|Grookius]] puts on a frankly amazing show of close up magic, which is all the more impressive considering he is unable to lie while doing so.
