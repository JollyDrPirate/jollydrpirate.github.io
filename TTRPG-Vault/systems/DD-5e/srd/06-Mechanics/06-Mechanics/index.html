Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities—a creature’s assets as well as weaknesses.</p><p>The three main rolls of the game—the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll—rely on the six ability scores. The book’s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.</p><p><strong>Ability Scores and Modifiers</strong> Each of a creature’s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities related to that ability.</p><p>A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.</p><p>Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from −5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.</p><a href=#ability-scores-and-modifiers><h2 id=ability-scores-and-modifiers><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Ability Scores and Modifiers</h2></a><table><thead><tr><th>Score</th><th>Modifier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>−5</td></tr><tr><td>2–3</td><td>−4</td></tr><tr><td>4–5</td><td>−3</td></tr><tr><td>6–7</td><td>−2</td></tr><tr><td>8–9</td><td>−1</td></tr><tr><td>10–11</td><td>+0</td></tr><tr><td>12–13</td><td>+1</td></tr><tr><td>14–15</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>16–17</td><td>+3</td></tr><tr><td>18–19</td><td>+4</td></tr><tr><td>20–21</td><td>+5</td></tr><tr><td>22–23</td><td>+6</td></tr><tr><td>24–25</td><td>+7</td></tr><tr><td>26–27</td><td>+8</td></tr><tr><td>28–29</td><td>+9</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>+10</td></tr></tbody></table><p>To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).</p><p>Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.</p><a href=#advantage-and-disadvantage><h2 id=advantage-and-disadvantage><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Advantage and Disadvantage</h2></a><p>Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p><p>If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.</p><p>If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.</p><p>When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.</p><p>You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The</p><p>GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.</p><a href=#proficiency-bonus><h2 id=proficiency-bonus><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Proficiency Bonus</h2></a><p>Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.</p><p>Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.</p><p>Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.</p><p>By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.</p><p>In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.</p><a href=#ability-checks><h2 id=ability-checks><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Ability Checks</h2></a><p>An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.</p><p>For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class.</p><p>The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.</p><a href=#typical-difficulty-classes><h4 id=typical-difficulty-classes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Typical Difficulty Classes</h4></a><table><thead><tr><th>Task Difficulty</th><th>DC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Very easy</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Easy</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Hard</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Very hard</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Nearly impossible</td><td>30</td></tr></tbody></table><p>To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.</p><a href=#contests><h3 id=contests><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Contests</h3></a><p>Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal— for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.</p><p>Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.</p><p>If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.</p><a href=#skills><h3 id=skills><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Skills</h3></a><p>Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.)</p><p>For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.</p><p>The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.)

In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.</p><p>For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.</p><a href=#variant-skills-with-different-abilities><h4 id=variant-skills-with-different-abilities><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Variant: Skills with Different Abilities</h4></a><p>Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.</p><a href=#passive-checks><h3 id=passive-checks><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Passive Checks</h3></a><p>A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.</p><p>Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:</p><p>10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check</p><p>If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a <strong>score</strong>.</p><p>For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.</p><p>The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.</p><a href=#working-together><h3 id=working-together><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Working Together</h3></a><p>Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who’s leading the effort—or the one with the highest ability modifier—can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.</p><p>A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.</p><a href=#group-checks><h4 id=group-checks><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Group Checks</h4></a><p>When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren’t.</p><p>To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.</p><p>Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.</p><a href=#using-each-ability><h2 id=using-each-ability><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Using Each Ability</h2></a><p>Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.</p><a href=#strength-1><h3 id=strength-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Strength</h3></a><p>Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.</p><a href=#strength-checks><h4 id=strength-checks><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Strength Checks</h4></a><p>A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.</p><p><em><strong>Athletics.</strong></em> Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:</p><ul><li>You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.</li><li>You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.</li><li>You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Other Strength Checks.</strong></em> The GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul><li>Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door</li><li>Break free of bonds</li><li>Push through a tunnel that is too small</li><li>Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it</li><li>Tip over a statue</li><li>Keep a boulder from rolling</li></ul><a href=#attack-rolls-and-damage><h4 id=attack-rolls-and-damage><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Attack Rolls and Damage</h4></a><p>You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand- to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.</p><a href=#lifting-and-carrying><h4 id=lifting-and-carrying><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lifting and Carrying</h4></a><p>Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.</p><p><em><strong>Carrying Capacity.</strong></em> Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.</p><p><em><strong>Push, Drag, or Lift.</strong></em> You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Size and Strength.</strong></em> Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.</p><a href=#variant-encumbrance><h5 id=variant-encumbrance><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Variant: Encumbrance</h5></a><p>The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.</p><p>If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are <strong>encumbered</strong>, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.</p><p>If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead <strong>heavily encumbered</strong>, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.</p><a href=#dexterity-1><h3 id=dexterity-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Dexterity</h3></a><p>Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.</p><a href=#dexterity-checks><h4 id=dexterity-checks><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Dexterity Checks</h4></a><p>A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.</p><p><em><strong>Acrobatics.</strong></em> Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.</p><p><em><strong>Sleight of Hand.</strong></em> Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket.</p><p><em><strong>Stealth.</strong></em> Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.</p><p><em><strong>Other Dexterity Checks.</strong></em> The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul><li>Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent</li><li>Steer a chariot around a tight turn</li><li>Pick a lock</li><li>Disable a trap</li><li>Securely tie up a prisoner</li><li>Wriggle free of bonds</li><li>Play a stringed instrument</li><li>Craft a small or detailed object</li></ul><a href=#attack-rolls-and-damage-1><h4 id=attack-rolls-and-damage-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Attack Rolls and Damage</h4></a><p>You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.</p><a href=#armor-class><h4 id=armor-class><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Armor Class</h4></a><p>Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.</p><a href=#initiative><h4 id=initiative><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Initiative</h4></a><p>At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in combat.</p><a href=#hiding><h4 id=hiding><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Hiding</h4></a><p>The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.</p><p>You can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.</p><p>An <a class="internal-link broken">invisible</a> creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.</p><p>In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.</p><p><em><strong>Passive Perception.</strong></em> When you hide, there’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.</p><p><em><strong>What Can You See?</strong></em> One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be <strong><a href=/TTRPG-Vault/systems/DD-5e/srd/06-Mechanics/lightly-obscured rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/TTRPG-Vault/systems/DD-5e/srd/06-Mechanics/lightly-obscured>lightly</a></strong> or <strong><a href=/TTRPG-Vault/systems/DD-5e/srd/06-Mechanics/heavily-obscured rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/TTRPG-Vault/systems/DD-5e/srd/06-Mechanics/heavily-obscured>heavily obscured</a></strong>, as explained in chapter 8, “Adventuring.”</p><a href=#constitution><h3 id=constitution><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Constitution</h3></a><p>Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.</p><a href=#constitution-checks><h4 id=constitution-checks><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Constitution Checks</h4></a><p>Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.</p><p>The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul><li>Hold your breath</li><li>March or labor for hours without rest</li><li>Go without sleep</li><li>Survive without food or water</li><li>Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go</li></ul><a href=#hit-points><h4 id=hit-points><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Hit Points</h4></a><p>Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.</p><p>If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.</p><a href=#intelligence-1><h3 id=intelligence-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Intelligence</h3></a><p>Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.</p><a href=#intelligence-checks><h4 id=intelligence-checks><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Intelligence Checks</h4></a><p>An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.</p><p><em><strong>Arcana.</strong></em> Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.</p><p><em><strong>History.</strong></em> Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.</p><p><em><strong>Investigation.</strong></em> When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p><p><em><strong>Nature.</strong></em> Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.</p><p><em><strong>Religion.</strong></em> Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.</p><p><em><strong>Other Intelligence Checks.</strong></em> The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul><li>Communicate with a creature without using words</li><li>Estimate the value of a precious item</li><li>Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard</li><li>Forge a document</li><li>Recall lore about a craft or trade</li><li>Win a game of skill</li></ul><a href=#spellcasting-ability><h4 id=spellcasting-ability><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Spellcasting Ability</h4></a><p>Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p><a href=#wisdom-1><h3 id=wisdom-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Wisdom</h3></a><p>Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.</p><a href=#wisdom-checks><h4 id=wisdom-checks><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Wisdom Checks</h4></a><p>A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.</p><p><em><strong>Animal Handling.</strong></em> When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.</p><p><em><strong>Insight.</strong></em> Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.</p><p><em><strong>Medicine.</strong></em> A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.</p><p><em><strong>Perception.</strong></em> Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.</p><p><em><strong>Survival.</strong></em> The GM might ask you to make a</p><p>Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.</p><p><em><strong>Other Wisdom Checks.</strong></em> The GM might call for a</p><p>Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul><li>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li><li>Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead</li></ul><a href=#spellcasting-ability-1><h4 id=spellcasting-ability-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Spellcasting Ability</h4></a><p>Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p><a href=#charisma-1><h3 id=charisma-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Charisma</h3></a><p>Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.</p><a href=#charisma-checks><h4 id=charisma-checks><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Charisma Checks</h4></a><p>A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.</p><p><em><strong>Deception.</strong></em> Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast- talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.</p><p><em><strong>Intimidation.</strong></em> When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.</p><p><em><strong>Performance.</strong></em> Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.</p><p><em><strong>Persuasion.</strong></em> When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.</p><p><em><strong>Other Charisma Checks.</strong></em> The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul><li>Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip</li><li>Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation</li></ul><a href=#spellcasting-ability-2><h4 id=spellcasting-ability-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Spellcasting Ability</h4></a><p>Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p><a href=#saving-throws><h2 id=saving-throws><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Saving Throws</h2></a><p>A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.</p><p>To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.</p><p>A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.</p><p>Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.</p><p>The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.</p><p>The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.</p><a href=#adventuring><h1 id=adventuring><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Adventuring</h1></a><a href=#time><h2 id=time><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Time</h2></a><p>In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale of <strong>minutes</strong>. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.</p><p>In a city or wilderness, a scale of <strong>hours</strong> is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours’ time.</p><p>For long journeys, a scale of <strong>days</strong> works best.</p><p>Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.</p><p>In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on <strong>rounds</strong>, a 6-second span of time.</p><a href=#movement><h2 id=movement><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Movement</h2></a><p>Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor, scaling a treacherous mountain slope—all sorts of movement play a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.</p><p>The GM can summarize the adventurers’ movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: “You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: “After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.”</p><p>Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they’re moving over.</p><a href=#speed><h3 id=speed><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Speed</h3></a><p>Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life- threatening situation.</p><p>The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p><a href=#travel-pace><h4 id=travel-pace><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Travel Pace</h4></a><p>While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.</p><p><em><strong>Forced March.</strong></em> The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of <a class="internal-link broken">exhaustion</a>.</p><p>For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of <a class="internal-link broken">exhaustion</a> (see appendix A).</p><p><em><strong>Mounts and Vehicles.</strong></em> For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.</p><p>Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace.

But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground—all considered difficult terrain.</p><p>You move at half speed in difficult terrain— moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.</p><a href=#special-types-of-movement><h3 id=special-types-of-movement><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Special Types of Movement</h3></a><p>Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking.

At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.</p><a href=#jumping><h4 id=jumping><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Jumping</h4></a><p>Your Strength determines how far you can jump.</p><p><em><strong>Long Jump.</strong></em> When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.</p><p>This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.</p><p>When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.</p><p><em><strong>High Jump.</strong></em> When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.</p><p>You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.</p><a href=#the-environment><h2 id=the-environment><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Environment</h2></a><p>By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.</p><a href=#falling><h3 id=falling><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Falling</h3></a><p>A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.</p><a href=#suffocating><h3 id=suffocating><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Suffocating</h3></a><p>A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).</p><p>When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.</p><p>For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.</p><a href=#vision-and-light><h3 id=vision-and-light><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Vision and Light</h3></a><p>The most fundamental tasks of adventuring— noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few—rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.</p><p>A given area might be lightly or <a href=/TTRPG-Vault/systems/DD-5e/srd/06-Mechanics/heavily-obscured rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/TTRPG-Vault/systems/DD-5e/srd/06-Mechanics/heavily-obscured>heavily obscured</a>.

A creature effectively suffers from the <a class="internal-link broken">blinded</a> condition (see appendix A) when trying to see something in that area.
^heavily-obscured</p><p>The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: <a href=/TTRPG-Vault/systems/DD-5e/srd/06-Mechanics/bright-light rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/TTRPG-Vault/systems/DD-5e/srd/06-Mechanics/bright-light>bright light</a>, <a href=/TTRPG-Vault/systems/DD-5e/srd/06-Mechanics/dim-light rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/TTRPG-Vault/systems/DD-5e/srd/06-Mechanics/dim-light>dim light</a>, and <a href=/TTRPG-Vault/systems/DD-5e/srd/06-Mechanics/darkness rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/TTRPG-Vault/systems/DD-5e/srd/06-Mechanics/darkness>darkness</a>.</p><p><strong>Bright light</strong> lets most creatures see normally.

Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.</p><p>A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of <a class="internal-link broken">exhaustion</a>.</p><p>A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.</p><a href=#water><h4 id=water><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Water</h4></a><p>A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of <a class="internal-link broken">exhaustion</a> at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of <a class="internal-link broken">exhaustion</a> at the end of the day.</p><p>If the character already has one or more levels of <a class="internal-link broken">exhaustion</a>, the character takes two levels in either case.</p><a href=#interacting-with-objects><h3 id=interacting-with-objects><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Interacting with Objects</h3></a><p>A character’s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.</p><p>For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.</p><p>Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object’s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.</p><p>A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check.</p><a href=#resting><h2 id=resting><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Resting</h2></a><p>Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest—time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.</p><p>Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.</p><a href=#short-rest><h3 id=short-rest><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Short Rest</h3></a><p>A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.</p><p>A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.</p><a href=#long-rest><h3 id=long-rest><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Long Rest</h3></a><p>A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity—the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.</p><p>At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character’s total number of them (minimum of one die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.</p><p>A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.</p><a href=#between-adventures><h2 id=between-adventures><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Between Adventures</h2></a><p>Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.</p><p>In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.</p><a href=#lifestyle-expenses><h3 id=lifestyle-expenses><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lifestyle Expenses</h3></a><p>Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.</p><p>Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.</p><a href=#downtime-activities><h3 id=downtime-activities><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Downtime Activities</h3></a><p>Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.</p><p>Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.</p><a href=#crafting><h4 id=crafting><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Crafting</h4></a><p>You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.</p><p>For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5- gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.</p><p>Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.</p><p>While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.</p><a href=#practicing-a-profession><h4 id=practicing-a-profession><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Practicing a Profession</h4></a><p>You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.</p><p>If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves’ guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.</p><p>If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.</p><a href=#recuperating><h4 id=recuperating><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Recuperating</h4></a><p>You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.</p><p>After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:</p><ul><li>End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.</li><li>For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.</li></ul><a href=#researching><h4 id=researching><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Researching</h4></a><p>The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.</p><p>When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone’s aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.</p><p>For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.</p><a href=#training><h4 id=training><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Training</h4></a><p>You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.</p><p>First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.</p><p>The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://jollydrpirate.github.io/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by JollyDrPirate using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://jollydrpirate.github.io/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://jollydrpirate.github.io/>HOME</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
